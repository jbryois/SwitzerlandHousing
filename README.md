# SwitzerlandHousing

This projects aims to predict rent prices in Switzerland based on data from the anibis.ch website.

The structure of the project is the following:

1) A python script downloads housing data from anibis.ch and performs some initial cleaning

2) An R script cleans the data further and evaluate different mixed models and machine learning models for rent prediction

3) A shiny app predicts housing prices based on the best model (a linear mixed model).
